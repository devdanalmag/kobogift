    q: "What happens if the recipient never claims?",

  {
    q: "How does the recipient get a wallet without setup?",

  {
    q: "Who pays the gas fee for the claim?",
    a: "A relayer covers the gas on behalf of the recipient. Since Arc uses USDC as gas and fees are around $0.01, this is sustainable. The recipient pays absolutely nothing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can someone steal my gift link?",
    a: "The claim secret lives only in the URL fragment (#) — it never reaches our servers and is not stored anywhere. Only someone with the exact full link can claim. Treat it like cash.",

    q: "Is this on mainnet?",
